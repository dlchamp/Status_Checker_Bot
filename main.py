This is a simple bot designed for @Courier :envelope:
As requested, this bot will run a status check at 1PM local time every day
If the members' status == the STATUS_MESSAGE variable, a message is sent to the channel
designated by the MESSAGE_CHANNEL variable

Set your bot token in the .env-sample file, then rename the file to .env
